this task is to build a simple electronic scale, the scale consist of 8 weight sensors (weight sensor 
is one kind of sensor otherwise a transducer. The working principle of the weight sensor depends 
on the conversion of a load into an electronic signal). Each sensor generates an analog signal from 
0 to 5 V that corresponds to the weight 0 to 125 grams respectively. So the system can measure 
any weight from 0 to 1KG with a precision of 0.5 grams.
